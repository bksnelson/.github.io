## **Coding Standards**
Coding standards, often dismissed as mere stylistic preferences, have a profound impact on software engineering. While some may debate the minute details of indentation and brace placement, implementing one technique to improve software quality should be the implementation of coding standards. These standards serve as a backbone of well-organized code and readability.

## **My first week**
My first week with ESLint and IntelliJ was filled with challenges and rewards. The green checkmark of correctly formatted code is a painful reminder of imperfections and a valuable pursuit of clean code. While addressing ESLint warnings seemed tedious, each correction helped me step closer to code consistency, readability, and improved quality.

## **Utility**
The utility of the green checkmark extends beyond validation, it becomes a source of motivation and a visual cue for embracing best practices. The integration of ESLint and IntelliJ is a great combination that not only enforces coding standards but also assists with learning a programming language by promoting a structured and consistent coding style.

## **Final thoughts**
Overall, coding standards are not just for keeping things stylized, but a strategic decision that shapes the foundations of software development. Through ESlint and IntelliJ, Iâ€™ve come to appreciate their roles in safeguarding code quality and standards. Committing to this standard is not just about the syntax, but also about elevating the art of coding.
