Software engineering is a dynamic and ever-evolving field that captivates my interest. My interest in software engineering converges with the things I use in my life frequently, such as websites, mobile apps and video games. Learning to go into these fields may be a challenge, but provide a unique opportunity for creativity that gives me great motivation to study harder.

In the expansive field of web development, my goal is to build robust and visually appealing websites that deliver seamless user interactions. The intricacies of what goes on in the background compared to what the user sees seem quite complicated, but it allows for the use of visual creativity more than most platforms. The web as a platform offers a lot to build upon, like creating functional elegance and creating lasting impressions. 

With app development, my focus shifts to applications that can integrate into our daily lives. Whether it be apps for productivity or entertainment, I aim to develop a balance of front end and back end functionality. The mobile market is rapidly growing and is becoming more popular, so my hope is to jump into something that I can competitively work into.

With video game development, I am drawn to the construction of virtual landscapes and creating compelling gameplay experiences. This field offers a great amount of opportunity for creative expression and technical precision that I want to test myself with. With upcoming technologies such as AR and VR I hope to find myself in the middle of video game development to contribute to an art form that can take individuals into new worlds.
